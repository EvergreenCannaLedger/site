## The Bottom Line Up Front  
The 4/20 Surge — and the Slide That Follows

April 20th, or “4/20,” remains the cannabis industry’s most celebrated sales event of the year. But if you’re in Massachusetts, the 2025 data tells a more nuanced story. While holiday sales spiked, the **post-4/20 pullback was sharp** — and this year’s performance even paled in comparison to 2024’s record-setting numbers.

For cannabis business owners, budtenders, and brand marketers, these trends hold valuable lessons for promotions, inventory, and staffing strategies.

## 4/20 2025 vs. Typical Days: By the Numbers  
**Total Sales and Year-Over-Year Snapshot**

Single-day sales (4/20/25): $4.87 million
— Down 54.3% from $8.5M on 4/20/2024

Three-day Patriots’ Day/4/20 weekend (Apr 19–21): $14.62 million
— Down 23.2% from $18.45M in 2024

April 2024 average daily sales: Estimated $4.5 million/day
— 4/20/25 slightly above this average, suggesting muted lift

TECL Insight:
Despite the holiday, 4/20 sales in 2025 were underwhelming, falling short of 2024 and barely exceeding a typical day based on last year’s run rate.

Here’s a look at how each major product type performed before and after the holiday, revealing patterns of spike and regression:

## Key Takeaways for Cannabis Operators
1. Holiday Spike, Then Swift Normalization
All categories surged on 4/20 — especially buds and edibles. The post-holiday week showed significant pullbacks: up to –53% in unit sales and –46% in dollar sales for beverages.

2. Buds Remain the Backbone
Despite a volume drop, flower retained demand post-4/20 with the smallest dollar-sales dip (–22%). This stability suggests it’s still the most resilient and consistent revenue generator.

3. Novelty Formats See the Sharpest Swings
Infused beverages and edibles saw some of the largest spikes on 4/20 — but also the steepest drop-offs afterward. Great for holiday promotions, but risky to overstock.

4. Pre-Rolls and Concentrates Show Mid-Level Volatility
Pre-rolls had a +150% spike on 4/20, but saw less severe declines afterward, making them solid limited-time SKUs.

5. Medical Sales Stay Steady
As in previous years, medical-use sales were flat, reinforcing that 4/20 is an adult-use consumer event.

## Marketing & Ops Tips for 4/20 2026
**What to Do:**  
+ Stock up early on high-demand formats like pre-rolls, beverages, and edibles — but be ready to scale back quickly.
+ Plan for a multi-day surge (especially if tied to weekends or local holidays like Patriots’ Day).
+ Target adult-use consumers with experiential promotions (tastings, bundles, limited editions).

**What to Avoid:**
+ Over-ordering novelty products — they crash post-4/20.
+ Staffing too heavily for the week after the holiday.
+ Assuming last year’s record trends will repeat; 2025 shows normalization.

## The Evolving 4/20 Consumer  
2025 data signals a maturing cannabis market in Massachusetts. While 4/20 still moves the needle, its effect is tapering relative to previous years — likely due to:

+ Market saturation
+ Consumer fatigue
+ More balanced purchasing behavior

For brands and dispensaries, this means smarter planning is essential. The focus should shift from “sell everything in one day” to “maximize the moment without overcommitting.”
