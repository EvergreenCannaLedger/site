The **Cannabis Central Reporting System (CCRS)** became known on Dec 6,
2021, replacing BioTrackTHC as the traceability reporting software
vendor at Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board (WSLCB).\
Initial months of CCRS to track cannabis movements from farm to shelf
saw only a handful of licensees submitting data — a signal of the
state’s slow enforcement rollout.    

Here's what the research shows - major traceability system transitions
have occurred since 2013. The CCRS is the state's third attempt at
wrangling cannabis traceability data from license holders. News articles 
surrounding the CCRS transition and official rollout status is bound to happen.
But, The Evergreen Canna Ledger is more about CCRS data journalism. 

Washington State's cannabis regulatory history includes three major
transitions of traceability software systems coming online since 2013:

| Year | Event |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **2013** | WSLCB adopts **BioTrackTHC** as the traceability vendor |
| **2017** | WSLCB switches from BioTrack to **MJ Freeway (Leaf Data Systems)** |
| **2021** | Gradual **sunsetting of Leaf Data Systems**; licensees encouraged to move to **third‑party APIs** via **CCRS** |
| **September 2021** | Full **shutdown of Leaf** traceability system; reporting now required via **flat‑file uploads to WSLCB‑CCRS** |

\
Why it matters:

Dec 2021 was a transition period — most, if not all, licensees had not
yet fully adopted or integrated the new CCRS system. 

CCRS required licensees to manually upload CSVs, which are known to be error-prone,
unfamiliar than "Excel file," and comes with a lack of enforcement clarity.

However, there are no real-time validations codified — files could be incomplete
or incorrect, and they would still "upload." This alone builds distrust between the 
cannabis citizens and business owners and the government to do their job backed by 
tax-payer money. 

As a result, reports may lag or be inconsistent for a while,
especially among smaller operators or those without robust IT support.

The sparse licensee activity starting from the 2021 December CCRS Traceability Report
wasn't a reflection of a dormant market, rather it was a mirror to the software 
upheaval in Washington’s traceability system with the thousands of cannabis license holders.

What looked like a vacant marketplace at year-end 2021 was
actually a byproduct of regulatory and technical limbo.

Why so few licensees in December 2021?

| Factor | Impact |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Traceability System Transition | Licensees were moving from Leaf → CCRS |
| Data Reporting Friction | New CSV/flat-file submission was confusing, manual, and inconsistently adopted |
| Lack of Enforcement | When CCRS fully launched, reporting was not strictly enforced |
| Manual Data Uploads | Errors, delays, and gaps were common |
| Enforcement Tightened | In Dec. 2022, determine if compliance improved; Is there a 5-year enforcement plan?? |
