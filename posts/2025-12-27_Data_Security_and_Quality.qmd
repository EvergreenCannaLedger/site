## The Bottom Line Up Front
In the fast-paced world of industry-level reporting of cannabis movements to state agencies and regulators, publicly-available data is more than just numbers. For us, it’s the backbone of business strategy, regulatory compliance, and competitive business intelligence. But without security and accuracy, data is nothing more than just noise. For cannabis operators and businesses in Washington, TECL stands out as a reliable platform where cutting-edge technology meets rigorous data integrity. But how does it all work? What makes this platform trustworthy? Let’s take a deep dive into the technology that powers TECL.

## The Foundation: R STUDIO and ARROW-PARQUET 
At the heart of TECL is a robust, scalable infrastructure designed to ensure both data security and lightning-fast performance. We thought ahead to bring your the best. This foundation is built on:

**R STUDIO:** All raw data files are securely stored on our 1TB Dell machine, a trusted industry leader in computing hardware. The platform leverages CRAN and Github's advanced package standards, ensuring that data pipeline is always tidy, consistent, and protected — both at rest and in transit.

**R PACKAGES:** As a byte-scale data warehouse, parquet files allow TECL to handle massive CCRS datasets without sacrificing speed. This means you can explore millions of rows of cannabis transactions in seconds. 

For cannabis businesses, data security isn’t just a technical concern — it’s a legal and reputation-based one. Mishandling data in any way can result in fines, loss of customer trust, or even a shutdown. 

## Here’s how TECL safeguards CCRS information

**Encryption:** Data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, ensuring it cannot be intercepted or tampered.

**Access Control:** TECL implements business-to-business and other role-based access, ensuring users only see what they are permitted to view. TECL shares freely on data integrity-we share the data process in the story.

**Regular Security Audits:** The platform undergoes continuous security monitoring, with automated alerts for any suspicious activity. We also have operating procedures for internal data review and verification.

**From Raw to Reliable: The Data Cleaning Process** Raw data can be hot mess — duplicates, missing values, and fat-fingered entries are common. For TECL, accuracy is a non-negotiable standard. The data cleaning process ensures that only high-quality, reliable information reaches users:

**Data Extraction:** TECL combines hundreds of traceability files directly from Washington’s state cannabis system every month.
Automated Data Cleaning: The TECL platform uses advanced SQL algorithms to identify and remove duplicates, correct errors, and normalize and aggregate data for consistency.

**Data Validation:** Data points are cross-referenced for accuracy against the producer’s or retailer’s website, ensuring that users can trust the insights they receive.

**Proprietary Scoring Logic:** Beyond basic cleaning, TECL enhances the data with proprietary scoring and ranking, making it even more insightful to know who to do business with.

**Real-Time Data Updates: Keeping Insights Fresh** In an industry as dynamic as cannabis in any US state, stale data is useless. TECL is designed for continuous data updates and refreshes, ensuring users always have access to the latest market insights:

**Monthly Data Refresh:** New data files are imported every month, maintaining an up-to-date view of the cannabis market.

**On-Demand Custom Reports:** Users can instantly query all data without any delay and download the custom report.

**Instant Dashboard Updates:** The dashboards automatically reflect the most recent data, giving users real-time insights.
