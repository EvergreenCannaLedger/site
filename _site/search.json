    "text": "Patterns in SKU Churn\nKey Findings\nThe majority of licensees (≈95%) reported no deleted SKUs — a sign of product stability or static reporting.\nA small but meaningful minority (&lt;5%) showed churn rates exceeding 10–25%, suggesting active experimentation or seasonal turnover.\nDeletion peaks often correspond with brand reformulations, packaging changes, or strain reclassification events following state compliance updates.\nTop Churn Drivers\n\nRebranding: New product names under the same formulation (e.g., “Cured Resin” → “Live Cured Resin”).\nSKU Consolidation: Streamlining duplicate UPCs or package sizes.\nSeasonal SKUs: Holiday drops, limited runs, and cross-licensee collaborations.\n\n Survivorship and Market Maturity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric\nMedian\nHigh Performer\nLow Performer\n\n\n\n\nTotal SKUs\n10,851\n70,838\n&lt;100\n\n\n% Survived ≥6 months\n97.5%\n100% (Evergreen Market – Renton Highlands)\n91% (Small farm licensees)\n\n\n\nOn average, 97% of SKUs survived six months, indicating that most active products remain stable once introduced. However, a few licensees — often multi-store operators — maintain rapid turnover, balancing large active portfolios with aggressive SKU pruning.\n To complement churn, we calculated SKU survivorship — the percentage of SKUs still active ≥6 months post-creation:\nInterpreting Brand Behavior\nThe blend of Active, Deleted, and Survived SKUs offers a behavioral window into brand strategy: Every product tells a story — from creation to deletion.\nAs Washington’s cannabis market enters its second decade, product turnover has become one of the clearest indicators of brand maturity and market experimentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Behavior\nSKU Signature\nStrategic Implication\n\n\n\n\nStable Core Brands\nHigh Active, Low Deleted\nMature portfolio with consistent labeling and compliance control\n\n\nExperimenters\nModerate Active, High Deleted\nTesting formulations or packaging (common in mid-sized processors)\n\n\nDormant Licensees\nLow Active, Few or No Deleted\nLimited sales or inactive reporting\n\n\nHigh Survivors\n100% 6-month retention\nStrong product-market fit, reliable sell-through\n\n\n\n Branding Consistency and Churn\nBy comparing branding detection (via product name/description matching against licensee DBA) with lifecycle data:\n\nSelf-branded products remain a small fraction of total SKUs (&lt;5%), echoing prior ECL findings.\nBrands with the highest deletion rates tend to show lower naming consistency — hinting at experimental portfolios or co-packing arrangements.\nConversely, high-survivorship brands display strong lexical uniformity (stable naming conventions, SKU prefixes, and descriptors).\n\nThe conclusion is churned SKUs reveal experimentation and surviving SKUs reflect name identity.\nCounty-Level Observations\nMapping deleted vs. active SKUs by licensee county showed geographic nuances:\n\nKing and Spokane counties dominate total SKU creation, but deletion rates remain low — emphasizing market stability.\nSmaller counties (e.g., Skagit, Okanogan) exhibit higher proportional churn, driven by boutique processors testing niche products.\n\nThis aligns with broader trends: urban stability, rural experimentation.\nWhy SKU Lifecycle Matters\nSKU churn isn’t just noise — it’s a signal.\nTracking deletion and survivorship helps identify:\n\nEmerging innovators (high churn, frequent product refreshes)\nOperationally consistent brands (stable SKUs, long retention)\nCompliance bottlenecks (spikes in deletions following CCRS schema changes)\n\nFor regulators and analysts alike, SKU lifecycle metrics offer a leading indicator of product-market fitness and business discipline."

For years, plant counts rose with almost no corrective response, allowing volume to accumulate unchecked. It was not until late 2021 that destruction activity began to register meaningfully — and even then, it lagged far behind production volume.\nBy 2024–2025, this imbalance reached unprecedented levels. In October 2024 alone, more than 1.3 million plants were created, while only 101,190 were destroyed — a destruction rate under 8%. Similar patterns persisted through early 2025, despite visible declines in retail demand and pricing.\nThis indicates a structural issue: production capacity has dramatically outpaced market absorption.\nCannabis Data Democracy in Practice\nTECL’s mission is to move Washington cannabis away from intuition-based production toward accountable, measurable, and transparent decision frameworks. Plant lifecycle efficiency is not a backend compliance metric — it is a predictive indicator of operational intelligence. The ability to reduce waste, anticipate production risk, and select high-performance strains is what will define the next generation of sustainable cannabis operators."

In 2022–2023, most retailers kept discounts conservative (5–10 %), targeting margin stability. By 2025, however, discounts averaged 12 % across April, peaking near 21 % in the first week, as retailers fought to capture early-season shoppers.\nThe trend suggests a more mature price war dynamic:\nLarger operators leveraging volume promotions,\nSmaller boutiques differentiating through niche products rather than deep discounts, and\nStatewide consumer sensitivity to holiday deals rivaling mainstream retail events like Black Friday.\n Weekly Summary\n\n\n\nWeekly Summary for April 2022–2025\n\n\nMonth\nWeek\nLicensees\nTotal Revenue\nAvg.

From 2022 through 2024, the number of reporting licensees, monthly revenue, and discounting behavior all evolved in ways that signal a maturing, highly competitive retail market.\nBetween 2022 and 2024, total reported revenue increased nearly 9×, while the number of reporting licensees jumped from under 300 to more than 4,600 unique businesses. With CCRS data quality improving and participation expanding, the Evergreen State’s cannabis economy is finally achieving the kind of transparency and scale seen in mature retail sectors.\n\nYearly Totals at a Glance:\n\n\n\nYear\nLicensees Reporting\nTotal Revenue\nAvg.

Using CCRS data compiled through DuckDB, The Evergreen Canna Ledger analyzed three years of April performance—2022, 2023, and 2024—to understand how participation, total revenue, and discount behavior evolved during this key retail window.\nThe data reveal a clear pattern: participation and revenue have expanded sharply, while discount strategies have become more measured and sustainable over time.\n\nMonthly Comparison Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 2022 to 2024, the number of retailers reporting April sales grew more than fourfold, while total monthly revenue expanded nearly six times. This growth reflects both increased CCRS compliance and broader retail coverage across Washington’s market.\nThe 2023 season marked a turning point: retailers generated over $5 million in April sales with minimal average discounting, showing that demand remained strong even without deep markdowns. By April 2024, both participation and discounting normalized, with more than 60 licensees and a modest 5% average discount rate, suggesting healthy competition and strategic pricing.\n Monthly Summary Table\n\n\n\nApril Monthly Summary (2022–2024)\n\n\nYear\nLicensees Reporting\nTotal Revenue\nAvg.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Bottom Line Up Front\nThe data revealed an industry transitioning out of its onboarding phase into a steady operational rhythm. 2022’s surge captured the “great normalization” of CCRS retail data; 2023 represents the first full year of true trend comparability, where growth rates slowed but reliability improved.\nAs of December 2023, Washington’s cannabis retail sector appears stable, data-rich, and increasingly efficient — a sign that the Evergreen State’s open-data framework is now supporting genuine market intelligence for both regulators and the industry itself.\nOverview\nBetween December 2021 and December 2023, Washington’s cannabis retail landscape evolved from a fragmented set of early CCRS participants into a broad, maturing network of consistently reporting licensees. Using CCRS sales data integrated through DuckDB, The Evergreen Canna Ledger tracked monthly and quarterly changes in revenue, participation, and discounting behavior across two years of industry data.\nWhat emerges is a story of early growth, mid-cycle correction, and late-stage stabilization—a pattern consistent with normalization in new regulatory markets.\n Monthly Licensees Reporting Writing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipation and Growth\nIn December 2021, only 8 licensees were actively reporting, generating roughly $2.7 million in sales. By December 2022, participation surged to 51 active licensees, moving over $16.5 million in monthly retail volume—an increase of more than 500% in reported revenue and sixfold growth in participation.\nThe first half of 2023, however, saw a contraction in both revenue and reporting, as several smaller or seasonal operators dropped from the dataset. From January to March 2023, licensee counts fell from 31 to 13, while monthly revenue dropped by nearly half—from $6.7 million to $3.3 million.\nThis retrenchment was followed by steady re-entry: by late 2023, the active licensee count recovered to 39, suggesting renewed reporting consistency and stronger compliance coverage.\n Quarterly Revenue & Discount Trends Revenue by Quarter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscount % by Quarter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear-over-Year & Month-over-Month % Change in Revenue\nYoY Revenue Change\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoM Revenue Change\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotably, while total revenue peaked in late 2022, the 2023 rebound suggests the market has stabilized around a sustainable revenue band of $15–20 million per quarter, with more balanced pricing strategies and consistent consumer demand.\n Scatter Plot: Revenue vs. Discount %\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscounting Behavior\nDiscount trends provide insight into how retailers managed price pressure through this adjustment period.\n\nEarly 2022: Discounts fluctuated wildly—from −2% in January to 21% in February—indicating experimental pricing and data entry inconsistencies as CCRS reporting expanded.\nLate 2022: Discounts tightened to near zero, reflecting confident retail margins and strong demand.\n2023: Average markdowns hovered between 1–6%, suggesting more strategic, seasonal discounting rather than widespread price compression.\n\nThis steadier pricing approach aligns with the maturing competitive environment—where differentiation is increasingly driven by product category mix and brand identity rather than blunt price cuts.\n\nSummary Table – Monthly CCRS Data\n\n\n\nMonthly Summary of CCRS Sales – Dec 2021 to Dec 2023\n\n\nMonth\nLicensees\nRevenue\nAvg.

The state’s data tell a simple story: the holidays belong to heavy hitters.\nFor analysts, regulators, and retailers alike, this year-end surge provides a roadmap for what to expect as the market continues to formalize — where data, timing, and product mix will define who wins the next year-end “green holiday season.”\nWhat It Means for 2023 The 2022 holiday data underscore several structural trends that would carry into 2023 and beyond:\n\nHigh Concentrate Dependency: The market is top-heavy — over 60% of total value tied to inhalable extracts.\nFlat Discounting: Despite economic pressure, retailers avoided margin erosion in premium segments.\nData Coverage Expansion: More licensees submitted CCRS-compliant data than ever before, improving transparency and market analysis.\n\nTogether, these indicators reflect a maturing, efficiency-driven cannabis economy — one increasingly resembling conventional consumer packaged goods (CPG) industries in its seasonal planning, price targeting, and brand hierarchy.\n Topline Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric\nValue\n\n\n\n\nPeriod\nNov 25, 2022 – Jan 1, 2023\n\n\nTotal Revenue\n≈ $925 million\n\n\nTop Product Category\nConcentrates for Inhalation ($577 M, 62%)\n\n\nNumber of Reporting Licensees\n~60\n\n\nPeak Sales Day\nDecember 22, 2022\n\n\nPeak Category Share\nConcentrates: 65% of total sales\n\n\n\n Overview\nBetween Black Friday (Nov 25) and New Year’s Day (Jan 1), Washington’s cannabis market recorded one of its most intense and diverse retail periods to date. Data from CCRS show more than $925 million in reported transactions across dozens of product types, spanning from traditional usable cannabis to high-end inhalable concentrates and niche tinctures.\nThe holiday window highlighted both the breadth of Washington’s cannabis supply chain and its evolving retail dynamics — where price, product form, and potency all shaped consumer behavior heading into 2023.\nCCRS cannabis sales during the 2022 holiday season, specifically from Black Friday (Nov 25, 2022) through New Year’s Day (Jan 1, 2023).\nThis ledger post covers:\n\nRevenue by product type\nRevenue vs. units sold by product type\nDaily sales trends by product type\nBusiness and inventory type grouping\nRevenue per gram (normalized by weight)\nDiscount behavior by product type\nTotal revenue per licensee\n\nWe can now answer:\nWho sold the most usable cannabis or pre-rolls?\nWhich product type had the most discounting behavior?\nHow efficient was each product in terms of revenue per gram?\n Revenue by Product Type\n\n\n\nTotal Revenue by Product Type\n\n\nInventoryType\ntotal_revenue\n\n\n\n\nConcentrate For Inhalation\n$5,495,206,267\n\n\nNA\n$742,467,153\n\n\nUsable Cannabis\n$232,610,894\n\n\nCannabis Mix Infused\n$18,526,597\n\n\nFlower Lot\n$15,605,433\n\n\nLiquid Edible\n$12,878,058\n\n\nSolid Edible\n$6,244,932\n\n\nCannabis Mix Packaged\n$4,674,771\n\n\nOther Material Unlotted\n$1,994,607\n\n\nTincture\n$609,927\n\n\nEthanol Concentrate\n$540,603\n\n\nTopical Ointment\n$443,266\n\n\nHydrocarbon Concentrate\n$277,304\n\n\nNon-Solvent based Concentrate\n$22,344\n\n\nCO2 Concentrate\n$16,099\n\n\nCapsule\n$13,032\n\n\nSample Jar\n$6,912\n\n\nFood Grade Solvent Concentrate\n$5,855\n\n\nSuppository\n$1,930\n\n\nTransdermal\n$523\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue vs. Units Sold by Product Type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily Sales Trends by Product Type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Consumers Bought\nConcentrates for Inhalation absolutely dominated, generating $577 million, or nearly two-thirds of total holiday sales. Traditional usable cannabis (flower) followed distantly at $76 million, while edibles (solid and liquid combined) made up under 1% of overall sales.\nThe dominance of extract-based products underscores how established consumers — especially those purchasing in bulk or for gifting — have shifted toward higher-potency forms.\n\nRevenue by Business + Product Type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue per Gram by Product Type\n\n\n\nAverage Revenue per Gram by Product Type\n\n\nInventory Type\nRevenue Per Gram (Mean)\n\n\n\n\nTransdermal\n$84.96\n\n\nNon-Solvent based Concentrate\n$32.49\n\n\nCO2 Concentrate\n$32.11\n\n\nTopical Ointment\n$27.93\n\n\nTincture\n$21.34\n\n\nHydrocarbon Concentrate\n$13.41\n\n\nSolid Edible\n$10.97\n\n\nEthanol Concentrate\n$9.21\n\n\nFood Grade Solvent Concentrate\n$7.70\n\n\nConcentrate For Inhalation\n$7.02\n\n\nCannabis Mix Packaged\n$6.73\n\n\nCannabis Mix Infused\n$4.46\n\n\nCapsule\n$3.61\n\n\nUsable Cannabis\n$3.55\n\n\nLiquid Edible\n$2.51\n\n\nSample Jar\n$0.91\n\n\nFlower Lot\n$0.83\n\n\nSuppository\n$0.65\n\n\nOther Material Unlotted\n$0.23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice and Value: How Much Was a Gram Worth?\nDuring the holiday window, Transdermals and CO₂ concentrates fetched the highest prices per gram, reflecting niche medical and artisanal segments. The price stratification shows a clear tiering of Washington’s cannabis economy — from everyday flower under $4/gram to boutique topicals and extracts exceeding $80/gram.\nThis divergence reveals a key insight:\nRetailers protected margin on high-demand inhalables while discounting slower-moving, niche categories like tinctures and topicals to clear shelf space before year-end.\n\nDiscount Behavior by Product Type\n\n\n\nAverage Discount % by Product Type\n\n\nInventory Type\nDiscount Percent (Mean)\n\n\n\n\nTincture\n17.8%\n\n\nNon-Solvent based Concentrate\n16.2%\n\n\nCapsule\n9.1%\n\n\nCO2 Concentrate\n7.8%\n\n\nSolid Edible\n6.5%\n\n\nHydrocarbon Concentrate\n6.1%\n\n\nFood Grade Solvent Concentrate\n5.2%\n\n\nTransdermal\n5.0%\n\n\nTopical Ointment\n3.2%\n\n\nLiquid Edible\n0.7%\n\n\nSample Jar\n0.7%\n\n\nEthanol Concentrate\n0.2%\n\n\nNA\n0.1%\n\n\nConcentrate For Inhalation\n0.0%\n\n\nFlower Lot\n0.0%\n\n\nOther Material Unlotted\n0.0%\n\n\nSuppository\n0.0%\n\n\nCannabis Mix Infused\n-0.1%\n\n\nCannabis Mix Packaged\n-0.2%\n\n\nUsable Cannabis\n-0.2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscount Behavior: Who Marked Down for the Holidays\nDiscounting varied widely across product categories.

Baker Homegrown.\nThese producers and processors form Washington’s “holiday backbone” — scaling up concentrate and extract output to meet December demand surges.\nThe Calendar of the Holiday Rush\nAnalysis of daily sales data shows two major waves:\n\nBlack Friday Spike (Nov 25–29): modest volume dominated by flower and edibles.\nMid-December Explosion (Dec 8–22): multiple high-value concentrate surges, with record-breaking single-day totals exceeding $60 million (Dec 8).\nSales fell sharply on Christmas Day and spiked again from aDec 26–30, ending with elevated New Year’s Eve totals.\n\nHoliday demand and inventory management strategy must mirror mainstream retail trends; early promotional engagement, mid-December inventory runs, and late-month re-stocking by retailers before the post-holiday season and typical January slowdown."

    "text": "Despite popular belief that deep discounts drive 4/20 success, the data suggest a more nuanced picture. Washington’s strongest performers in April 2022 leveraged loyalty, brand equity, and consistent pricing strategies as much as they relied on markdowns. As the state’s cannabis market matures, future 4/20 seasons may hinge more on timing, product mix, and customer segmentation than sheer discount depth.\nThe below CCRS dataset is not large nor comes with much depth, however, we were able to gain business insights in this analysis mostly from the few licences that did correctly input their information into the CCRS report.\nRetailer Discounting Activity Around 4/20 (April 2022)\nWeekly Discount % and Revenue Around 4/20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Weekly revenue trends for top six retailers (plotly interactive line chart)\nThis figure illustrates how total weekly revenue evolved through April 2022. “Suspended Brands” spiked sharply the week of 4/18 — likely driven by bulk holiday promotions or large-scale wholesale transfers — whereas “Lucid” and “Green Lady Lacey” show smooth, high-discount consistency across all four April weeks.\nDiscount % by Week – Same Businesses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Discount % vs. Revenue among top retailers A scatter plot comparing total April revenue against mean weekly discount percentage reveals that moderate discounting (10–30%) was most effective in maintaining revenue levels. The highest earners did not necessarily discount most deeply — suggesting that strategic brand positioning, not just markdowns, influenced 4/20 outcomes.\nTable: Discount & Revenue by Week (Top Retailers)\n\n\n\nWeekly Discount % and Revenue by Retailer (April 2022)\n\n\nBusinessName\nWeekStart\ndiscount_pct\ntotal_revenue\n\n\n\n\nGREEN LADY LACEY\n2022-03-28\n28.2%\n$256,971\n\n\nGREEN LADY LACEY\n2022-04-04\n30.1%\n$906,480\n\n\nGREEN LADY LACEY\n2022-04-11\n30.2%\n$467,892\n\n\nGREEN LADY LACEY\n2022-04-18\n28.7%\n$501,829\n\n\nGREEN LADY LACEY\n2022-04-25\n30.2%\n$532,359\n\n\nISSAQUAH CANNABIS COMPANY\n2022-03-28\n2.6%\n$84,054\n\n\nISSAQUAH CANNABIS COMPANY\n2022-04-04\n2.0%\n$195,087\n\n\nISSAQUAH CANNABIS COMPANY\n2022-04-11\n1.6%\n$195,566\n\n\nISSAQUAH CANNABIS COMPANY\n2022-04-18\n33.8%\n$366,790\n\n\nISSAQUAH CANNABIS COMPANY\n2022-04-25\n3.7%\n$784,974\n\n\nLANDRACE\n2022-04-04\n0.0%\n$1,426,688\n\n\nLUCID\n2022-03-28\n28.2%\n$146,840\n\n\nLUCID\n2022-04-04\n30.1%\n$517,988\n\n\nLUCID\n2022-04-11\n30.2%\n$267,367\n\n\nLUCID\n2022-04-18\n28.7%\n$286,759\n\n\nLUCID\n2022-04-25\n30.2%\n$304,205\n\n\nORIGINS\n2022-03-28\n6.3%\n$306,039\n\n\nORIGINS\n2022-04-04\n9.7%\n$689,146\n\n\nORIGINS\n2022-04-11\n9.4%\n$709,619\n\n\nORIGINS\n2022-04-18\n16.8%\n$922,632\n\n\nORIGINS\n2022-04-25\n4.6%\n$559,020\n\n\nSUSPENDED BRANDS\n2022-04-18\n0.0%\n$12,592,325\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of What This Does:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nSaleDate\nGroups sales by week (i.e. 4/4, 4/11, 4/18, 4/25)\n\n\ndiscount_pct\nWeekly discount percent: SUM(Discount) / SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity)\n\n\ntotal_revenue\nWeekly revenue per business\n\n\ntop_businesses\nFocuses plots on top 6 businesses by revenue\n\n\nlineplots\nGenerates interactive line charts for both revenue and discounting\n\n\ntable\nNicely formatted summary table for reference or export\n\n\n\nDuring April 2022, Washington’s cannabis retailers entered one of the most competitive 4/20 seasons since the state’s market began tracking sales.

Six stood out for both sales volume and activity surrounding the 4/20 weekend:\nSuspended Brands led by a wide margin with more than $4.0 million in sales during the week of April 18.\nLandrace followed with over $1.4 million in weekly revenue and little to no discounting — indicating strong brand pricing power.\nGreen Lady Lacey and Lucid both showed steady discount programs of 28–30% across April, suggesting consistent promotional strategies rather than one-time 4/20 blowouts.\nOrigins maintained moderate discounting (6–17%) but achieved over $500 K per week, indicating a high-volume, moderate-discount approach.\nPink Grassland LLC held prices firm (0% discounting) while sustaining smaller but steady weekly sales around $100–140 K.\nOverall, discount intensity varied widely: most retailers offering &gt;25% discounts tended to preserve or slightly increase revenue through the holiday, while zero-discount retailers showed stable but flat weekly performance."

To understand how licensees were performing during those pivotal early weeks, we analyzed nearly 12 thousand transactions covering the Black Friday–Christmas–New Year’s 2021 period.\nThe dataset captures point-of-sale activity reported by a handful of early CCRS adopters—primarily the Lucid retail group and Green Lady Lacey—and offers a snapshot of how products, pricing, and discounting behaved across inventory types.\n\n\n\nInventory Type\nTotal Revenue ($)\nUnits Sold\n\n\n\n\nUsable Cannabis\n13,905\n3,846\n\n\nConcentrate for Inhalation\n1,910\n–138\n\n\nTincture\n1,526\n–90\n\n\nSolid Edible\n353\n18\n\n\nSample Jar\n0.24\n2,142\n\n\nTopical Ointment\n0\n12\n\n\n(Unspecified) NA\n17,264\n14,652\n\n\n\nFlower (usable cannabis) dominated legitimate revenue, generating roughly 40 % of all recorded sales, while concentrates and tinctures together accounted for another 10 %–12 %.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Cannabis Central Reporting System (CCRS) became known on Dec 6, 2021, replacing BioTrackTHC as the traceability reporting software vendor at Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board (WSLCB).\nInitial months of CCRS to track cannabis movements from farm to shelf saw only a handful of licensees submitting data — a signal of the state’s slow enforcement rollout.\nHere’s what the research shows - major traceability system transitions have occurred since 2013. The CCRS is the state’s third attempt at wrangling cannabis traceability data from license holders. News articles surrounding the CCRS transition and official rollout status is bound to happen. But, The Evergreen Canna Ledger is more about CCRS data journalism.\nWashington State’s cannabis regulatory history includes three major transitions of traceability software systems coming online since 2013:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nEvent\n\n\n\n\n2013\nWSLCB adopts BioTrackTHC as the traceability vendor\n\n\n2017\nWSLCB switches from BioTrack to MJ Freeway (Leaf Data Systems)\n\n\n2021\nGradual sunsetting of Leaf Data Systems; licensees encouraged to move to third‑party APIs via CCRS\n\n\nSeptember 2021\nFull shutdown of Leaf traceability system; reporting now required via flat‑file uploads to WSLCB‑CCRS\n\n\n\n\nWhy it matters:\nDec 2021 was a transition period — most, if not all, licensees had not yet fully adopted or integrated the new CCRS system.\nCCRS required licensees to manually upload CSVs, which are known to be error-prone, unfamiliar than “Excel file,” and comes with a lack of enforcement clarity.\nHowever, there are no real-time validations codified — files could be incomplete or incorrect, and they would still “upload.” This alone builds distrust between the cannabis citizens and business owners and the government to do their job backed by tax-payer money.\nAs a result, reports may lag or be inconsistent for a while, especially among smaller operators or those without robust IT support.\nThe sparse licensee activity starting from the 2021 December CCRS Traceability Report wasn’t a reflection of a dormant market, rather it was a mirror to the software upheaval in Washington’s traceability system with the thousands of cannabis license holders.\nWhat looked like a vacant marketplace at year-end 2021 was actually a byproduct of regulatory and technical limbo.\nWhy so few licensees in December 2021?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor\nImpact\n\n\n\n\nTraceability System Transition\nLicensees were moving from Leaf → CCRS\n\n\nData Reporting Friction\nNew CSV/flat-file submission was confusing, manual, and inconsistently adopted\n\n\nLack of Enforcement\nWhen CCRS fully launched, reporting was not strictly enforced\n\n\nManual Data Uploads\nErrors, delays, and gaps were common\n\n\nEnforcement Tightened\nIn Dec. 2022, determine if compliance improved; Is there a 5-year enforcement plan??\n\n\n\nSources used for this article: Cannabis Observer, WSLCB Board Meetings, Public concerns about CCRS rollout and data quality, Leaf Data Systems Retirement Announcement (https://lcb.wa.gov/traceability/leaf-data-sunset).\n\nadd ad block using raw html"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Interpretive Summary\nThe 2022 trajectory underscores a maturing Washington cannabis retail ecosystem. Rather than relying on steep price competition, most retailers achieved growth through steady CCRS entry and reporting, consistent pricing, and expanding consumer access.\nThis period marked the state’s first stable data baseline for comparing retail performance trends — setting the stage for 2023’s focus on category-specific and regional dynamics. \n Quarterly Observations\nQ1 2022: Erratic pricing behavior — February’s 21% average discount spike likely reflected early inventory clearing by smaller operators.\nQ2 2022: Stabilization around 5–10% discounts, with moderate sales momentum and 14–18 active licensees.\nQ3 2022: Expansion phase — participation exceeded 20 licensees for the first time, paired with steady discount compression to below 3%.\nQ4 2022: Strongest revenue quarter of the year, led by November–December growth exceeding $13M monthly. Discount averages returned near zero, signaling high consumer demand despite minimal markdowns. \n\n#Query Monthly Sales, Discount, and Licensee Count\n\nmonthly_sales &lt;- dbGetQuery(con, \"\nWITH base AS (\nSELECT\nsh.LicenseeId,\nDATE_TRUNC('month', CAST(sh.SaleDate AS DATE)) AS Month,\nCAST(sd.UnitPrice AS DOUBLE) AS UnitPrice,\nCAST(sd.Quantity AS DOUBLE) AS Quantity,\nCAST(sd.Discount AS DOUBLE) AS Discount\nFROM SalesDetail_all sd\nJOIN SaleHeader_all sh ON sd.SaleHeaderId = sh.SaleHeaderId\nWHERE DATE(sh.SaleDate) BETWEEN '2021-12-01' AND '2022-12-31'\nAND CAST(sd.UnitPrice AS DOUBLE) &lt; 200\n)\nSELECT\nMonth,\nCOUNT(DISTINCT LicenseeId) AS licensee_reporting,\nROUND(SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity), 2) AS total_revenue,\nROUND(SUM(Discount) / NULLIF(SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity), 0) * 100, 2) AS avg_discount_pct\nFROM base\nGROUP BY Month\nORDER BY Month\n\")\n\nLicensees Reporting by Month\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

Total Revenue and Average Discount Percent An overlay plot illustrates the inverse relationship between price discounting and sales growth: as discounts narrowed, total revenue rose steadily — suggesting that broad market participation, not aggressive markdowns, was driving sales expansion.\nAverage Discount % by Month\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Total Average Discount Percent by Month An overlay plot illustrates the average discount percent on a monthly basis. As discounts narrowed, total revenue rose steadily — suggesting that markdowns may correlate to THC levels in products or shrewd inventory management during the calendar year.

Using CCRS licensee data aggregated through DuckDB, The Evergreen Canna Ledger tracked monthly sales, total revenue, and average discount levels from December 2021 through December 2022.\nAt the start of the period — December 2021 — only 8 licensees actively reported sales, generating roughly $2.7 million in total revenue. By December 2022, that number had grown to 51 active licensees and $16.6 million in total monthly revenue — a sixfold increase in participation and over a fivefold increase in sales.\nThis rapid growth highlights two key dynamics:\nMarket Expansion: Throughout the first half of 2022, the number of reporting licensees grew from 8 to 18 by May, mirroring the state’s ongoing onboarding of retailers submitting CCRS data consistently. Revenue followed the same trajectory, climbing from $1.5 million in April to over $6.5 million by July.\nDiscount Normalization: After early volatility — with average discounts swinging between -2% and 21% in the first quarter — retailers converged toward modest markdowns of 0–3% by the end of 2022. This stabilization indicates that price corrections and promotional strategies were maturing as competition intensified."

    "text": "The Bottom Line Up Front\nWashington’s cannabis market entered 2024 with strong seasonal momentum. The data paint a picture of consolidated production, strategic discounting, and consumer diversification — hallmarks of a maturing, data-literate industry.\nFor established players like Happy Time, Freeland Cannabis Company, and Cliffs Cannabis, this holiday season affirmed their dominance. For emerging brands, it signaled a clear path forward: price intelligently, diversify product forms, and target the mid-December surge.\nPlotting daily totals shows a three-phase cycle:\n\nBlack Friday Weekend (Nov 25–27): Strong early engagement, led by flower and edibles.\nMid-December Boom (Dec 7–22): Daily totals exceed $2 million, driven by extract categories and HM Extracts’ solvent concentrate runs.\nPost-Christmas Plateau (Dec 26–31): Sustained sales through New Year’s Eve, signaling ongoing consumer demand rather than a single spike.\n\n Topline Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric\nValue\n\n\n\n\nPeriod\nNov 25, 2023 – Jan 1, 2024\n\n\nTotal Revenue\n≈ $120 million\n\n\nTop Product Category\nConcentrates for Inhalation ($23.4M, 22%)\n\n\nNumber of Reporting Licensees\n~42\n\n\nPeak Sales Day\nDecember 22, 2022\n\n\nPeak Category Share\nConcentrates: 29.5% of total sales\n\n\n\n Overview\nFrom November 25, 2023 (Black Friday) through January 1, 2024, Washington’s cannabis retail sector recorded a robust seasonal surge, with more than $120 million in reported transactions across 42 licensees.\nUnlike previous years, where inhalable concentrates dominated the field, the 2023–24 season saw a broader product mix — with flower, edibles, and infused products gaining ground as retailers competed for holiday shoppers through strategic discounting and product variety.\nThe Evergreen Canna Ledger analysis of CCRS data revealed three key themes:\n\nLicensee consolidation continues — the same top ten businesses accounted for 70%+ of total revenue.\nDiscount depth increased — non-solvent and hydrocarbon concentrates saw markdowns over 20%.\nEdibles and infused goods expanded market share, showing consumers’ shift toward giftable and convenient cannabis formats.\n\nWe can now answer:\nWho sold the most usable cannabis or pre-rolls?\nWhich product type had the most discounting behavior?\nHow efficient was each product in terms of revenue per gram?\n Revenue by Product Type\n\n\n\nTotal Revenue by Product Type\n\n\nInventoryType\ntotal_revenue\n\n\n\n\nNA\n$50,119,789\n\n\nConcentrate For Inhalation\n$38,761,588\n\n\nUsable Cannabis\n$37,976,502\n\n\nFood Grade Solvent Concentrate\n$17,896,571\n\n\nSolid Edible\n$16,591,234\n\n\nCannabis Mix Infused\n$13,943,835\n\n\nCannabis Mix Packaged\n$4,890,947\n\n\nHydrocarbon Concentrate\n$3,345,322\n\n\nLiquid Edible\n$3,104,059\n\n\nNon-Solvent based Concentrate\n$1,079,038\n\n\nTopical Ointment\n$805,499\n\n\nTincture\n$224,294\n\n\nFlower Lot\n$178,718\n\n\nTransdermal\n$144,891\n\n\nCO2 Concentrate\n$64,007\n\n\nCapsule\n$41,847\n\n\nEthanol Concentrate\n$31,777\n\n\nFlower Unlotted\n$22,852\n\n\nInfused Cooking Medium\n$1,841\n\n\nSample Jar\n$194\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue vs. Units Sold by Product Type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily Sales Trends by Product Type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation:\nThe top-grossing day, December 15, 2023, surpassed $3 million statewide, largely from inhalable concentrates and edible purchases.\nThe same core producers from 2022 retained their lead, but HM Extracts distinguished itself by nearly hitting $10 million in Food Grade Solvent Concentrate revenue alone — effectively reshaping the wholesale concentrate landscape.\nWhat Consumers Bought\nWhile concentrates remain central to Washington’s holiday market, edibles and infused goods surged — a sign that edible sharing, gift giving, and product exploration based consumption broadened the state’s holiday sales base.\n\nRevenue by Business + Product Type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue per Gram by Product Type\n\n\n\nAverage Revenue per Gram by Product Type\n\n\nInventory Type\nRevenue Per Gram (Mean)\n\n\n\n\nTincture\n$101.90\n\n\nNon-Solvent based Concentrate\n$53.42\n\n\nConcentrate For Inhalation\n$21.10\n\n\nCO2 Concentrate\n$18.60\n\n\nHydrocarbon Concentrate\n$17.75\n\n\nEthanol Concentrate\n$12.87\n\n\nTopical Ointment\n$11.02\n\n\nSolid Edible\n$8.47\n\n\nTransdermal\n$8.33\n\n\nCannabis Mix Packaged\n$6.53\n\n\nCannabis Mix Infused\n$6.05\n\n\nUsable Cannabis\n$5.72\n\n\nLiquid Edible\n$3.95\n\n\nCapsule\n$3.42\n\n\nFood Grade Solvent Concentrate\n$1.98\n\n\nInfused Cooking Medium\n$0.37\n\n\nSample Jar\n$0.02\n\n\nFlower Unlotted\n$0.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice and Value: How Much Was a Gram Worth?\nThe tincture segment led in per-gram value, a reflection of niche, high-margin sales to loyal customers despite limited volume.

The deeper markdowns among capsules, non-solvent extracts, and edibles suggest an active effort to move inventory and attract new consumers through price incentives.\n\nWho Drove the Market: Top Holiday Licensees Total Revenue per Licensee\n\n\n\nTotal Revenue per Licensee – Holiday Season 2022\n\n\nBusiness Name\nTotal Revenue\n\n\n\n\nFREELAND CANNABIS COMPANY\n$26,581,325\n\n\nHAPPY TIME\n$24,772,496\n\n\nANACORTES CANNABIS\n$18,559,474\n\n\nHM EXTRACTS\n$17,977,455\n\n\nCLIFFS CANNABIS\n$17,012,241\n\n\nCLARITY FARMS\n$13,643,796\n\n\nLUCID AUBURN, 21+ CANNABIS, 21+ MARIJUANA\n$11,773,994\n\n\nBUD COMMANDER\n$10,508,784\n\n\nLUCID PUYALLUP\n$10,480,703\n\n\nMOUNTAIN HI\n$9,192,638\n\n\nSHAWN KEMPS CANNABIS SODO\n$7,258,893\n\n\nISSAQUAH CANNABIS COMPANY\n$5,355,618\n\n\nHAPPY TIME LLC 2\n$5,110,228\n\n\nORIGINS\n$4,559,238\n\n\nHIGH END FARMS\n$2,194,410\n\n\nGREEN LADY LACEY\n$1,298,130\n\n\nBLOOMING CITY\n$1,165,076\n\n\nLUCID\n$741,789\n\n\nEXPERIENCE ORGANICS\n$247,443\n\n\nSASQUATCH CANNABIS COMPANY\n$181,346\n\n\nAVITAS\n$174,434\n\n\nEAST MOUNTAIN BUD\n$94,623\n\n\nAMERICAN MARY\n$63,974\n\n\nHYPOTHESIS GARDENS\n$54,843\n\n\nORIGINS CANNABIS\n$42,606\n\n\nSUNNCO WASHINGTON\n$34,873\n\n\nBOTANICAL ARTS\n$34,499\n\n\nHAYAA GREEN LLC\n$23,400\n\n\nLEGACY ORGANICS, LLC\n$19,500\n\n\nDANDELION FARMS\n$15,048\n\n\nAGRO COUTURE\n$10,999\n\n\nHERBAL E SCENTS\n$9,745\n\n\nROSLYN HERBS\n$8,633\n\n\nDIAMOND GREEN\n$8,507\n\n\nDOGTOWN PIONEERS\n$6,600\n\n\nGREEN ADVENTURES\n$3,168\n\n\nLOCALAMSTER\n$2,306\n\n\nSECRET HERB SHOP\n$1,628\n\n\nNÍKXNA OMAK\n$344\n\n\nBINX BUDS\n$0\n\n\nLOCAL AMSTERDAM\n$0\n\n\nROYAL GARDENS\n$0\n\n\nSATURN GROUPCERES\n$0\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Takeaways\n\nLicensee Concentration Remains High: The top ten brands captured over two-thirds of total holiday revenue.\nConcentrate Markets Matured: Solvent and solventless producers increased competition — reflected in discount levels approaching 25%.\nEdibles and Infused Goods Are Gaining Share: Growth in packaged and infused categories points to mainstream consumer adoption and gifting appeal.\nHoliday Planning Window Extended: Consistent late-December demand suggests retailers and processors can maintain strong sales beyond traditional “Black Friday–Christmas” cycles."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Bottom Line Up Front\nIn just three years, Washington’s cannabis holiday economy evolved from a small, high-margin niche into a billion-dollar retail machine. The numbers speak for themselves:\n\nMore participation,\nMore transparency, and\nMore competition.\n\nIf 2022 was the baseline and 2023 the trial run, then 2024 was the breakthrough year — a turning point when Washington’s cannabis market finally began behaving like the mature retail ecosystem it’s long promised to become.\nTrends at a Glance\n\n\n\nMetric\n2022 → 2023 Change\n2023 → 2024 Change\n\n\n\n\nLicensees Reporting\n▼ 30 %\n▲ 2,590 %\n\n\nTotal Revenue\n▼ 62 %\n▲ 2,885 %\n\n\nAvg. Discount %\n▲ 5.4 pts\n▲ 13.2 pts\n\n\n\nThe data reveal a classic emerging-market curve: contraction, adaptation, and explosive scale once systems and participation align.\n\nTotal Revenue by Year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBar Chart: Licensees Reporting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview\nEvery winter, Washington’s cannabis market tells a story through its data — a reflection of how retailers, producers, and consumers adapt to shifting regulations, supply dynamics, and price pressures.\nUsing statewide CCRS data from 2022 to 2024, we compared three key metrics for the holiday period (Black Friday → New Year’s Day):\nSummary Table\n\n\n\nYear\nLicensees Reporting\nTotal Revenue\nAvg. Discount %\n\n\n\n\n2022\n56\n$158 million\n0.46 %\n\n\n2023\n39\n$59.7 million\n5.88 %\n\n\n2024\n1,050\n$1.78 billion\n19.1 %\n\n\n\n\n2022 — A Cautious Baseline\nIn 2022, Washington’s cannabis retailers approached the holidays conservatively. Only 56 licensees reported data, generating roughly $158 million in revenue with virtually no discounting activity (0.46 %).\nThis period marked the post-pandemic normalization of retail operations: inventory was tight, margins were protected, and data participation was still fragmented. The industry’s watchword that winter was stability — not growth.\n2023 — A Contraction Year with Competitive Pressure\nBy 2023, total reported revenue fell sharply to $59.7 million, as only 39 active licensees submitted CCRS data during the holiday window.\nYet this smaller dataset revealed an important behavioral shift: average discounting jumped to 5.9 %, signaling that retailers began using price incentives to move volume amid rising competition and consumer price sensitivity.\n2023 thus stands as a compression year — one where operators tested markdown strategies and tightened cost controls ahead of the coming data-reporting expansion.\n2024 — Scale Arrives\nThen came 2024, and with it, the inflection point.\nMore than 1,000 licensees — a twenty-fold increase in participation — reported into CCRS. The result: a record $1.78 billion in holiday sales, accompanied by a statewide average discount rate of 19 %.\nThis surge reflects not only improved data integration and compliance but also a maturing market where retailers leveraged deep promotions to compete for share.\nInterpretation:\n2024 was the first year Washington’s cannabis industry achieved both complete visibility and mass consumer reach, transforming the holiday period into a true retail event comparable to mainstream sectors.\n\nBar Chart: Average Discount %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Interpretation\n1. Visibility and Compliance Drive Growth The 2024 leap in licensee reporting underscores how CCRS adoption and POS automation have matured. What was once a partial sample is now a comprehensive dataset.\n2. Discounts as a Competitive Tool\nThe escalation from &lt;1 % to &gt;19 % average discounts indicates the industry’s pivot toward retail economics — holiday promotions, bundling, and loyalty-based pricing.\n3. Economic Signal, Not Just Cultural\n4/20 and year-end periods now behave like standard consumer holidays, with predictable revenue spikes and price competition shaping fiscal calendars."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Bottom Line Up Front\nBetween 2021 and 2025, Washington’s cannabis market evolved from creative chaos to data-driven retail sophistication. “Novelty” is no longer just about new flavors or strain names — it’s about SKU efficiency, regional capacity, and consumer segmentation.\nThe state’s innovation curve now mirrors other mature retail categories: mass at the bottom, margin at the top, and variety in the middle.\nOverview\nFrom pre-rolls to live resin, Washington’s cannabis market has always thrived on novelty. But between 2021 and 2025, the pace and geography of product innovation shifted dramatically. Our CCRS dataset tracks new product introductions by county, showing how regional innovation, category saturation, and price competition evolved as the market matured.\nTwo visuals tell the story:\nA word cloud of the most frequent product descriptors (2021–2025).\nA rolling five-year plot of new product introductions by county.\nGeography of Innovation\nFrom 2021 to 2025, new product introduction rates rose sharply — but not uniformly. The visualization tracks top 10 Washington counties by number of new SKUs introduced within ±30 days of the New Year (a strong proxy for market-entry timing).\nKey Observations\n\nKing County led early innovation, leveraging its dense retail ecosystem and vertically integrated brands.\nBy 2024, Grays Harbor and Skagit emerged as surprise leaders, likely driven by processor expansions and data normalization in CCRS reporting.\nThe 2024 spike — over 200,000 new SKUs introduced — coincides with CCRS compliance improvements and mass data inclusion, not just product creativity.\n2025 saw normalization, with total introductions down ~40%, signaling saturation and a possible shift from expansion to optimization.\n\nCategory Performance and Emerging Trends\nFrom your category_summary data (2021–2025), several consistent leaders and emerging formats define Washington’s product landscape:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\n2025 Revenue\nPrice Trend\nKey Insight\n\n\n\n\nConcentrate for Inhalation\n$1.75B\nStable ($17–19)\nVolume growth with margin protection — consumer loyalty strong\n\n\nUsable Cannabis\n$1.57B\nFlat ($18–19)\nCommodity pricing sustained by branding and local loyalty\n\n\nSolid Edible\n$436M\nSlight decline\nMainstream snack form; giftable, portable\n\n\nLiquid Edible\n$203M\nPrice down ($10–11)\nBeverage entry-level category with lower per-unit margins\n\n\nHydrocarbon Concentrate\n$61M\nPrice pressure\nOvercapacity from 2024–2025\n\n\nEthanol Concentrate\n$49.8M\nUp sharply\nBoutique extraction methods gaining value status\n\n\nTopical Ointment\n$41M\nUp ($17→$22)\nStable wellness niche with rising unit value\n\n\n\n\nEmerging Categories\nCannabis Mix Infused and Packaged Mix (combined $250M in 2025) mark a bridge trend: convenient, pre-balanced hybrid formats for casual users.\nSuppositories, capsules, and transdermals remain tiny (&lt;$5M combined) but hold outsized potential in wellness and medical segments.\nRolling Plot: New Products Per Year by County\nWe’ll focus on top 10 counties by new product counts for legibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInnovation as a Geographic Signal\nThe novelty surge in 2024 wasn’t random — it coincided with processor proliferation outside major metros:\n\nSkagit and Grays Harbor counties showed unexpected innovation spikes, suggesting regional specialization.\nSpokane and Snohomish maintained steady upward trajectories, signaling healthy secondary markets.\nKing and Pierce counties — the traditional epicenters — saw slower relative growth, implying innovation decentralization.\n\nThe data points toward a distributed innovation ecosystem, where rural processors contribute as much new product diversity as urban brands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Language: What’s in a Name?\nWhen you strip away brand names and focus purely on descriptors, the linguistic center of Washington’s cannabis market is clear: “flower,” “concentrate,” “disposable,” “prefilled,” and “ infused” dominate.\nThese terms reflect a convergence of two product logics:\nThe traditional horticultural core (“flower,” “strain,” “resin,” “preroll,” “cookie,” “rosin”, “concentrate”)\nThe consumer electronics overlay (“battery,” “cartridge,” “vaporizer,” “vape,” “all-in-one,” “prefilled,” “handheld,” “disposable,” “portable,” “thread”)\nIn other words, Washington’s market has become both plant-based and plug-based. The old dispensary culture of jars and scales now coexists with vape pods, disposables, and portable oil-based systems.\nEven words like “bowl”, “pipe”, “smoke-able,” and “bong” still appear — relics of a pre-regulated, analog consumption era that remains embedded in brand storytelling.\nTrendy words like “infused”, “flavor”, “trichome-enriched” appear in brands effectively acquiring a loyal customer base.\n Commoditization vs. Premiumization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSegment\nExample\nMarket Behavior\n\n\n\n\nCommodity Base\nFlower Lot, Wet Flower, Unlotted Flower\nMassive volume, &lt;$2/unit, thin margins\n\n\nMid-Tier Engine\nConcentrates, Packaged Mix, Edibles\nReliable unit growth, stable pricing\n\n\nPremium Edge\nNon-Solvent, Ethanol, Topicals\nLow volume, strong pricing power\n\n\n\n Flower has officially entered commodity status — high volume, low differentiation. Meanwhile, premium extracts and wellness products show the opposite dynamic: modest growth but rising per-unit value, especially in solventless, CO₂, and ethanol-derived lines.\n Looking Ahead\nThe convergence of product variety, compliance transparency, and category maturity indicates that by 2026:\n\nSKU inflation will taper — fewer new products, more strategic portfolio management.\nFlower and concentrate prices will stabilize as economies of scale settle.\nMid-market edibles and wellness products will dominate branding and licensing partnerships.\nCounty-level innovation may shift toward formulation and co-packing, not just cultivation."

    "text": "The Bottom Line Up Front\nBy 2025, Washington’s cannabis sector has matured into a multi-tier retail ecosystem:\n\nCommodities at the base,\nConcentrates as the profit engine, and\nEdibles as the mass-market frontier.\n\nWhere 2021 looked like a boutique craft industry, 2025 looks like a full retail economy — one that behaves more like alcohol, coffee, or CPG snack categories than a novelty substance.\nThe future now depends less on legalization headlines and more on branding, vertical integration, and consumer segmentation.\nStructural Insights\nFlower Is Fully Commoditized Volume up 10× since 2022, average price &lt;$2/gram. Producers survive on efficiency and contracting.\nConcentrates Are the Cash Engine Price stability and margin integrity show brand loyalty and cross-category versatility (vape, dab, cart).\nEdibles Are the New Growth Driver Edibles now account for nearly 15% of statewide revenue, mirroring beverage and snack segmentation.\nNiche and Wellness Formats Are Stabilizing Topicals, tinctures, and transdermals maintain small but steady segments — a predictable, mature structure akin to supplements.\nOverview\nOver five years, Washington’s legal cannabis market transformed from a small, high-margin boutique sector into a scaled agricultural-retail ecosystem moving billions in volume.\nUsing CCRS data from 2021–2025, this analysis tracks category-level performance — who led, who lagged, and where the state’s cannabis economy is heading.\nThe numbers tell a dramatic story:\n\nFlower volumes exploded, but average prices fell below $2 per gram.\nConcentrates and edibles gained pricing power, driving premium revenue growth.\nInfused and packaged mixes emerged as mid-tier staples bridging convenience and potency.\nTopicals, tinctures, and niche forms maintained small but loyal markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Edibles: From Niche to Mainstream\nEdibles — both solid and liquid — surged in 2024–2025.\n\n\n\nYear\nSolid Edible Revenue\nLiquid Edible Revenue\nAvg Unit Price\n\n\n\n\n2022\n$1.9M\n$0.86M\n$12–17\n\n\n2023\n$8.5M\n$1.9M\n$12–18\n\n\n2024\n$334M\n$164M\n$10–17\n\n\n2025\n$436M\n$203M\n$10–17\n\n\n\n Observation\nThe “snack-ification” of cannabis has arrived. Solid edibles (chews, baked goods) are now a half-billion-dollar category, while liquid edibles and drinkables are approaching $200M. The steady per-unit pricing shows consumer normalization — edibles are no longer a novelty, they’re a staple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mid-Tier Expansion: Infused & Packaged Mixes\nOnce obscure, Cannabis Mix Infused and Cannabis Mix Packaged now represent nearly $250M combined revenue in 2025.\n\nInfused Mix: $167.8M (up 19% YoY)\nPackaged Mix: $84M (down slightly from 2024’s $106M)\n\nThese “bridge categories” combine flower with extracts or pre-packaged convenience — catering to value-driven consumers seeking ready-to-use products. Average unit prices hover near $9–10, confirming a stable mid-shelf positioning.\nThe Premium Edge: High-End Concentrates and Topicals\n\n\n\nProduct\nAvg Unit Price (2025)\nRevenue\n\n\n\n\nEthanol Concentrate\n$22.80\n$49.8M\n\n\nTopical Ointment\n$22.27\n$41.3M\n\n\nNon-Solvent Concentrate\n$30.50\n$12.3M\n\n\nCO₂ Concentrate\n$20.60\n$13.5M\n\n\n\nThese small-volume but high-margin categories anchor the upper end of the retail price spectrum, serving medical and wellness-oriented buyers. Notably, the Non-Solvent Concentrate segment has sustained $30+/unit pricing for three consecutive years, outperforming all other concentrate types on per-unit value.\nCommodities and Byproducts: The Low-End Expansion\nAt the other end of the curve, Flower Lot, Unlotted Flower, and Other Material categories exploded in sheer volume. This confirms a mature supply-chain phase — raw cannabis is now treated like a commodity crop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\n2025 Units Sold\nAvg Price\nComment\n\n\n\n\nFlower Lot\n490M\n$1.12\nBulk agricultural product\n\n\nFlower Unlotted\n233M\n$0.41\nLikely processor throughput\n\n\nOther Material Lot\n205M\n$0.60\nByproduct sales and waste streams\n\n\n\nThe price compression at this end underwrites the margin room for processors and retailers at the top.\n The Big Two: Flower and Concentrates\nUseable Cannabis\n\n2021: 38k units, $701K revenue, $18.16/unit\n2025: 123 million units, $1.57B revenue, $18.59/unit\n\nDespite volume expansion of &gt;3,000x, flower pricing has remained remarkably stable in retail terms — a sign of commoditization offset by branding and consistency. The data suggest growers are competing on scale, while retailers rely on product differentiation (strain lineage, terpene labeling) to sustain mid-teens per-unit pricing.\nConcentrate for Inhalation\n\n2021: $36K revenue\n2022: $74M\n2024: $1.36B\n2025: $1.75B\n\nConcentrates remain Washington’s economic backbone, accounting for roughly 40–45% of all cannabis revenue up to May 2025.\nAverage price per gram has held around $17–19, even as total volume climbed beyond 130 million units — a rare instance where scale didn’t crush price integrity. Consumers appear willing to pay for potency and convenience.\nInterpretation:\nConcentrates are now the oil of the cannabis economy — high-margin, logistics-friendly, and increasingly brand-defined.\n Emerging Niches and Curiosities\nWhile they barely register in total volume, several niche categories are showing steady experimentation and price elasticity:\n\nSuppository: $74.51/unit, up 30% YoY\nTransdermal: $11.54/unit, small but consistent volume\nCapsules: ~$14/unit, maintaining medical market traction\nClones & Seeds: &lt;$3/unit, reflecting agricultural base demand\n\nThese reflect the diversification of Washington’s cannabis economy — from high-THC recreational products to wellness, cultivation, and R&D inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The pricing landscape now mirrors consumer packaged goods: commodity base, strong mid-tier competition, and premium niches maintaining identity through quality and consistency.\n Market Growth at a Glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nTotal Revenue\nTop Category\nAvg. Price Range (Top 3 Categories)\n\n\n\n\n2021\n≈ $1.0M\nUsable Cannabis\n$15–18 per unit\n\n\n2022\n$95M\nConcentrate for Inhalation\n$9–16\n\n\n2023\n$55M\nUsable Cannabis\n$17–21\n\n\n2024\n$3.3B\nConcentrate for Inhalation\n$10–19\n\n\nJan-May 2025\n$4.2B\nConcentrate for Inhalation\n$10–18\n\n\n\n From 2021’s early-stage artisanal market to 2025’s billion-dollar scale, the data reveal a tenfold jump in total revenue and a massive broadening of licensee participation, especially post-2023 when full CCRS compliance took hold."

    "text": "Detect Self Branding SKUs by Category\nThe Broad SKU Majority\nRoughly 90% of active wholesalers fall into the “Broad SKU Mix” category — distributors with large, multi-type portfolios:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Wholesalers\nTotal SKUs\nDistinct Types\nPercent Self-Branded\nBranding Category\n\n\n\n\nSALISH COAST COMPANY\n6,121\n9\n0 %\nBroad SKU Mix\n\n\nCANNABIS GLASS\n26,385\n11\n0 %\nBroad SKU Mix\n\n\nKALEAFA\n5,628\n14\n0 %\nBroad SKU Mix\n\n\nCANNABIS COUNTRY STORE\n12,465\n9\n0 %\nBroad SKU Mix\n\n\n\nThese firms operate as regional distributors rather than house brands — high SKU diversity, but low self-branding.\nThey source and resell across categories, serving as aggregators of volume rather than architects of identity.\nThe “Other” Category: Niche Wholesalers The “Other” branding category, though small, is where Washington’s wholesale diversity shines. By joining licensees with product inventories and type counts, we identified 11 “Other” wholesalers spanning multiple niche categories.\n\n\n\nInventory Type\nTotal SKUs\nLicensee Count\n\n\n\n\nConcentrate for Inhalation\n141\n2\n\n\nPlant\n48\n11\n\n\nSeed\n31\n2\n\n\nClones\n28\n6\n\n\nOther Material Unlotted\n26\n6\n\n\nLiquid Edible\n24\n1\n\n\nSolid Edible\n19\n1\n\n\nOther Material Lot\n9\n1\n\n\nFlower Unlotted\n7\n1\n\n\nCannabis Mix Packaged\n3\n1\n\n\n\n Even within this small cohort, there’s remarkable variety. Some — like CHIEF N CANNABIS LLC — produce wet flower and concentrates, while others (e.g., WASHINGTON CANNABIS CORPORATION, COUNTRY LANE) specialize in plants, clones, and seed material.\nThese “Other” wholesalers serve critical ecosystem functions: supplying genetics, starter material, and specialty extracts — the inputs that keep both retail and manufacturing tiers viable.\n Branding Insights\nA few patterns stand out among all branding categories:\nSelf-Branding Remains Rare:\nFewer than 3% of wholesalers actively sell under their own label (PercentSelfBranded &gt; 10). The dominant strategy is contract manufacturing and third-party distribution.\nVertical Integration Is Selective:\nA handful of licensees — like KEEP IT GREEN PRODUCTIONS and SALISH COAST COMPANY — show internal production and distribution, but still manage external brands to fill catalog gaps.\nProduct Breadth ≠ Brand Identity:\nHaving more SKUs doesn’t imply stronger branding. Some of the largest distributors (25k–40k SKUs) remain brand-agnostic, highlighting a wholesale-as-infrastructure business model.\nAs Washington’s cannabis market matures, the spotlight has shifted from retail storefronts to the wholesale backbone supplying them.\nBetween 2024 and mid-2025, CCRS data show the emergence of two distinct wholesaler profiles:\n\nBroad SKU Wholesalers — large distributors with hundreds to thousands of SKUs across multiple product types and brand relationships.\n“Other” Wholesalers — smaller, often single-category operations specializing in plants, clones, edibles, or unbranded flower.\n\nThe analysis provide a rare look into how these entities shape the supply-side brand economy of Washington cannabis."
