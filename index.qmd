The Evergreen Cannabis Ledger (TECL) explores data-driven trends and insights across Washington’s cannabis industry — from licensee growth to sales distribution and policy impacts.  Analyzing Washington's CCRS Traceability data submitted by active cannabis license holders can help remove the human aspect of business decision making and effectively move toward a data-based decision framework used widely in many different businesses. 

The key to it all is accessing the data, formatting to analyze and visualize, and then, most importantly, use your interpretation with other knowledge to gain insight and at present time, make key decisions on near-future outcomes with clarity to remain competitive. 

TECL is an independent, data-forward initiative dedicated to advancing transparency, insight, and equity in Washington State’s regulated cannabis industry. Our mission is to democratize access to cannabis market intelligence by transforming complex CCRS traceability data into clear, actionable, and ethically grounded knowledge that benefits producers, licensees, policymakers, researchers, and the public.

## What We Do

The Evergreen Canna Ledger explores data-driven trends across Washington’s cannabis industry, including but not limited to:

+ Licensee growth and contraction trends

+ Sales patterns across retail, wholesale, and vertically integrated operators

+ Discount behavior and seasonal pricing signals

+ Product category evolution and novelty performance

+ Market consolidation and competitive dynamics

+ Regulatory and compliance implications

## Historical and forward-looking trend analysis

Using Washington’s CCRS Traceability data — submitted by licensed cannabis operators — we carefully clean, structure, and model this information to remove noise and minimize human bias in business analysis. The goal is not simply to visualize data, but to contextualize it through informed interpretation that supports smarter planning, resilient strategy, and ethical market participation.

## Our Vision

TECL aspires to become a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization focused on public-interest cannabis analytics, education, and open data advocacy. While we are not yet a registered nonprofit, our long-term vision includes:

+ Public-facing cannabis data reporting

+ Educational resources for licensees and communities

+ Market transparency initiatives

+ Collaborative research and policy analysis

+ Support for equitable participation in the cannabis economy

For now, we operate as an independent platform sustained by community engagement and project-based support.
